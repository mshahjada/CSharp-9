# CSharp-9

Here I've discused about some new feature available in C# 9.0

1. Records
2. Init only setters
3. Top-level statements
   Ignore this one becuase it's most easier. Remember that Only one file in your application may use top-level statements.
   without using Directives, namespace, class declaration you can execute top-level statements.
   System.Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
4. Pattern matching enhancements.
5. Fit and finish features
   It's kind of object creation new () when a variable/ method has specific type
6. New features for partial methods
